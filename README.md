## Overview

The Phishing Email Detector is a web application that allows users to input email text and receive a prediction on whether the email is a phishing attempt. The backend model is a deep learning model built using TensorFlow and Keras, while the web interface is built using Flask.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model consists of the following layers:

1. **Embedding Layer**: Converts input text into dense vectors of fixed size.
2. **SpatialDropout1D Layer**: Regularizes the model by randomly dropping a fraction of the input units.
3. **LSTM Layer**: Captures long-term dependencies in the text data.
4. **Dense Layer**: Outputs a probability value indicating whether the email is a phishing email.

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle. Here is the link to the [phishing dataset]("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset?select=phishing_email.csv.")
We train the model on the "phishing_email.csv" dataset.
